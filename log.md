### Getting started vs _feels_
1. I signed the MOU! _I still haven't sent the payment info bc am paranoid about sending banking info over the internet._
2. I edited my intro blog post! _Do I even know anything? Why can't I just pretend to at least sound intelligent?_
3. I installed git! I'm going to use try to use this as a note-taking thing! _Wow I don't remember git at all._
4. _I don't have time to take a headshot. I don't want to post on Instagram like I said I was going to do. Why am I so behind. I could use a snack. I am really lucky to be here._
5. Why does my github pages setup only have one page?
6. Let's just go with the old headshot. I can replace it later. 
7. Yay I have 3 projects! _Stop messing with this. Send the headshot. Get ready for bed._
