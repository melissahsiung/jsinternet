## 9/6/21 Monday: Labor Day
- Convo w/E re: how to harness NFT/crypto hype for climate action
- _Amusing Ourselves to Death_: Maybe it's not just the internet ruining discourse, maybe it started with TV. 
- Panicked about finding a 3rd teammate for CARL

## 9/3/21 Friday
### Done
1. Made progress on the scoping workshop structure. 
   - Reused slides from the GHG Accounting overview talk that only two people attended. I knew it wasn't a waste!
   - I want to use Miro but it was just much easier to sort things out in Slides. New tool overhead.
2. Really appreciated this article about the proliferation of crappy ed-tech: https://morningsidepost.com/articles/2021/4/5/primal-scream-dept-universities-including-columbia-suffer-from-too-many-inefficient-platforms
   - Tried to add & welcome the new SEA members to our school student engagement platform. Got stuck in a redirect. Finally guessed that it was due to our group's registration status. 
   - Preferred vs actual name bugs galore
3. First meeting with a potential CARL collaborator went well! Trying to think of speaking in 
4. Tried to post a video update with Instagram stories, didn't feel coherent enough
5. Posted fellow intro on GWF 

### Misc
- I have too many tabs and emails. Is this log just making things worse.
- IDEA: This disconnect & this idea of "lenses" reminds me of the NYT video about an eye disability: https://www.nytimes.com/video/opinion/100000007778961/strabismus-vision-disability-relationships.html 
   - "Sea of difference"


## 9/2/21 Thursday
- Seeing the flooding videos & rain stats was scary. So I ignored them, tried to find a Pema Chodron quote that would make sense, got distracted. Texted ppl instead. Everyone is safe.
- J read the SUMA DEI audit & is fired up to change things! 
- Got mad at a CAT member who dismissed security and moderation considerations as evaluation criteria for Slack alternatives bc they are probably the 'same across the board'. That is a REASON but where is the EVIDENCE. Wasted half an hour trying to write something constructive, gave up. 
- The weather was beautiful though

### WoCl/CAT EJ meeting
- Dates are set! S is contacting potential speakers to discuss Climate Justice x tech! 
- S & R are being very thoughtful, whereas I want to wing it and leave some flexibility in the agenda until we have a speaker (who can help us set the agenda). 
- I'm trying to remind myself that it's not about just doing an event, it's also about the collaborative process: (1) Learning to work in a flat structure, (2) learning about R & S & their backgrounds, (3) changing some of CAT & WoCl's processes (like offering an honorarium for the first time) 

### Tamer Hackathon Mixer
- Fitbit thought I was exercising, but I was just panicking before my intro.
- C, E & J were there! Pretty exciting to see them & hear about their projects.
- Gotta recruit some teammates! It's ok if there wasn't much interest. Just need to find 1 more person who 'gets' CARL.
- The meeting ran long & I had forgotten DJ had picked up pizza. Apologized profusely.

### Tried out Hypothes.is
- https://web.hypothes.is/
- C recommended
- I want to use this with SEA for commenting on the DEI report
- Will other people use it?
- Why does it keep crashing Chrome

### Distractions
- Who is better at guessing who's high? A teacher (the Cut), a cop (Buzzfeed) or an audience (Jimmy Kimmel)?
- Video games that Elon Musk recommends. I don't even like Elon Musk but Youtube has been recommending him!  Overwatch, Hearthstone, Deus X - original
- ADHD in Women: https://youtu.be/EMpt40zNK-w
- The Remarkable Woman Who (sorta) Invented Stuffed Animals: https://youtu.be/r3SR-fN4G48, Aug 31, 2021, vlogbrothers
> In which John discusses the extraordinary life of Margarete Steiff and the invention of stuffed animals. 
> I first learned about Margarete Steiff while researching the (genuinely astonishing) history of teddy bears; you can listen to my essay on them here: https://www.wnycstudios.org/podcasts/...
> History is both a story of individual people making choices, and a story of systems interacting, and stuffed animals are for me a way into glimpsing some of the complex interplays that create historical change.

### Getting started vs _feels_
1. I signed the MOU! _I still haven't sent the payment info bc am paranoid about sending banking info over the internet._
2. I edited my intro blog post! _Do I even know anything? Why can't I just pretend to at least sound intelligent?_
3. I installed git! I'm going to use try to use this as a note-taking thing! _Wow I don't remember git at all._
4. _I don't have time to take a headshot. I don't want to post on Instagram like I said I was going to do. Why am I so behind. I could use a snack. I am really lucky to be here._
5. Why does my github pages setup only have one page?
6. Let's just go with the old headshot. I can replace it later. 
7. Yay I have 3 projects! _Stop messing with this. Send the headshot. Get ready for bed._
